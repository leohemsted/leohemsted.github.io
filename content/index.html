I'm Leo! I'm a full stack python web developer currently based in west London.
<br/>
<br/>
I've been working with JavaScript, Python and Postgres for a few years now, and though it changes pretty regularly my current passions at work typically revolve around SQLAlchemy, setup.py, API design in general, and the jasmine.js testing framework.
